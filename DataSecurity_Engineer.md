# Summary

The **Data Security Engineer** role involves ensuring the security of big data environments by applying AI and big data analytics techniques to identify, mitigate, and prevent security vulnerabilities. The engineer is tasked with securing data pipelines, implementing robust encryption, managing access control, and ensuring that the data science and AI models within an organization are not compromised. They work closely with data science teams to secure sensitive data from both external threats (e.g., hackers) and internal threats (e.g., mismanagement or data leaks), ensuring the integrity and reliability of business-critical data.

# Baseline

- Deep knowledge of AI, big data systems, and security protocols.
- Experience in securing large-scale data environments, including cloud-based and on-premises systems.
- Familiarity with the latest trends and tools in data security and AI-driven vulnerability detection.

# Hard Skills

- Strong experience with big data frameworks such as Hadoop, Spark, and NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB).
- Expertise in machine learning and AI for identifying security vulnerabilities, including anomaly detection techniques.
- Hands-on experience with data encryption techniques, role-based access control (RBAC), and multi-factor authentication (MFA).
- Proficiency in using big data security tools such as Apache Ranger, Knox, and Sentry for securing large datasets.
- Understanding of data privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA) and how they affect AI and big data systems.
- Familiarity with cloud security, particularly in platforms such as AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure, with tools like GuardDuty, KMS, and IAM for securing data pipelines.

# Soft Skills

- Excellent problem-solving skills and ability to work with large cross-functional teams, including data scientists and AI engineers.
- Strong communication skills to relay complex security measures to non-technical teams.
- Proactive attitude in keeping up with the evolving nature of AI and big data security threats.

# Education

- Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Cybersecurity, or related fields.
- Advanced certifications in data security or AI (optional, but beneficial).

# Certification

- CISSP (Certified Information Systems Security Professional)
- CCSK (Certificate of Cloud Security Knowledge)
- CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker)
